### Contributions to Stake Capital from Feb 2021 - May 2022

## Stake DAO

**Note**: This is a publicised superset of my contributions made to private repositories. You may verify my contributions by getting in touch with Stake DAO's founder, Julien Bouteloup (@bneiluj on Twitter and Telegram, or let me know if in case he's not able to respond to you, I'll connect you).

### 1. DeFi Strategies

- Developed smart contracts for all strategies, except Angle USDC, at [Stake DAO's Strategy page](https://app.stakedao.org/0x640E35B6AfC3F6AD37bC14792536dA06e1C8cc19/strategies) with the assistance of two other smart contract developers.
- Strategies managed on an average of [$200 million safely for about a year](https://defillama.com/protocol/stakedao) before Stake DAO shifted focus to Liquid Lockers.
- Code documentation available at [Stake DAO Gitbook - Passive Strategies](https://stakedao.gitbook.io/stakedaohq/developers/deployed-contracts/ethereum/strategies/passive-strategies).

### 2. ERC1155 NFTs

- Collaborated with two other developers to create smart contracts for Stake DAO's ERC1155 NFTs. The cool thing about these NFTs was, they acted as entry tickets into strategies i.e. only people holding these NFTs were allowed to deposit inside few select strategies. NFTs were locked inside users' wallets once they entered a strategy, to avoid sybil attacks.
- Enabled gamification of the platform by allowing users to stake SDT, earn points, redeem NFTs, and stake NFTs to earn $SDT rewards based on their overall involvement (deposits) on the platform, using [DarkParadise.sol](https://github.com/StakeDAO/smart-contracts/blob/main/eth/nft/contracts/DarkParadise.sol)
- Code at [Stake DAO's GitHub - NFT Contracts](https://github.com/StakeDAO/smart-contracts/tree/main/eth/nft).

### 3. Options Strategies

- Conducted smart contract reviews for options strategies, which are automated strategies built on top of Opyn.
- Code documentation available at [Stake DAO Gitbook - Options Strategies](https://stakedao.gitbook.io/stakedaohq/developers/deployed-contracts/ethereum/strategies/options-strategies).

## Stake Capital Group
